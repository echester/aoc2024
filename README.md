# AoC 2024

A repo for my efforts for AoC 2024. Here we go again.
Here's what its all about: [[aoc2024](https://adventofcode.com)]

The _"comments"_ like this for each day are header comments from my code. For the first time ever I've joined a private leaderboard, so I'm curious to see how that plays out. I'm once again feeling that being in GMT is a poor choice of longitude: the folks west over the ocean can do it before bedtime, the folks a couple of hours east can have breakfast first. For the record - I fie upon your breakfast.

## Day 1 - Historian Hysteria

[PERL]

_"Massive props to Eric for another year of near-insanity in the pursuit of superior code skillz.For the avoidance of doubt - the comments were written afterwards, and the print debug
 removed... i'm not that professional. fo real."_

This was a suitable day 1 challenge, just grokking input and searching a list. Couple of interesting things for me: firstly that i messed up using a grep for part2 initially because of a stupid typo caused by my eyes being closed at 5am. 
The other is that I used an untyped sort, which assumes the inputs are strings. The correct way to do this would be the spaceship operator ```<=>``` to force numerical sort, but for my input file, it worked anyway. I can imagine cases where it might not.

## Day 2 - 

[PERL]

Day 2 always comes far too soon after day 1.
